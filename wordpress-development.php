<h3>How wordpress beneficial for business</h3>
  <p class="aboutus-text">
Many successful bricks-and-mortar business owners, on buying a domain, go into the experience with high hopes. Floods of traffic! Huge revenues! Automated fun!. These days, businesses are often required to use highly responsive websites; a text blurb and an email link no longer count as a true website. Business owners can mop up extra gravy online, but not if their website is a big Word Press Screenshot belly flop.</p>

<h3>2. WordPress SEO Tools</h3>
  <p class="aboutus-text">
All In One SEO and Yeast have given a strong boost to Word Press SEO. When you want to boost your local following, or you need to focus on an industry-specific keyword, WP's SEO tools are about as quick as you can have. All in One SEO, my personal favorite, exposes the Meta fields you need to add keywords, search titles, and search descriptions.</p>
<h3>3. Content Structuring & Taxonomy</h3>
  <p class="aboutus-text">
Drupal isn't the only player in the taxonomy game. While the Drop is king of complex organization, the platform's learning curve as a DIY system may be forbidding to some. With WP, there are multiple solutions for your organizational problems, like List by Post, which automatically organizes posts on a page according to the category. WP's built-in custom taxonomy system also lets you organize your site the way you like.</p>
<h3>4. WordPress Invoicing</h3>
  <p class="aboutus-text">
While you're busy building your website, you don't really need to dig out your invoicing software. As your other plugins bring in money and business, either they can do the invoicing themselves, or you can use plugins dedicated entirely to invoicing.</p>
